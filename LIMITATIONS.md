### Known Limitations and Issues

1. ``__import__`` statements, [a way to import modules with a function](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#import__), is not supported *yet*.
2. C Extensions for Python are not evaluated.
3. Parserkiosk is very new, rigourous testing is required and is currently missing!
